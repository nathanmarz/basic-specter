# basic-specter

This is an implementation of [Specter's](https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter) core features without any of the optimizations. This is intended as a reference to understand the basics of how Specter works. 

Most of Specter's selectors are not included in this reference. Also, this does not implement value collection or precompilation.
